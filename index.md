# Data Science Projects

# Freelance

[My freelance Hub](./freelance.html).

# Intro

- My previous experience at Datapred as well as my personal attraction for Data Science and Mathematics have developed a strong attraction for real-world applied Data Science projects that aim to generate value using state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques and finely selected data.

- My Engineering journey focused on obtaining development and communications skills related to Data Science. I am fond of Entrepreunership environment : in this context, I created my own entrepreuneurial podcast [Radio Plaisir](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMYQsRyZQ1tSosW9qF9N4zg).

- I'm actually working on a new project which consists of creating a french youtube channel based on popularising the Data Science.

# Languages

```
