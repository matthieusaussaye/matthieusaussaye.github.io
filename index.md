[My freelance Hub](./another-page.html).

# Experiences

Work experiences. I focused on obtaining Development skills related to Data Science. I am fond of Entrepreunership & startups : in this context, I created my own entreupreneriale podcast (Radio Plaisir).


### Datapred

# Projects

### Github projects.

> to complete

### Stochastic route planner (EPFL) - [Link to videb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy0noW0KA8k&feature=youtu.be).


> - Preprocessing of SBB (Swiss Railways) data. Pandas
> - Graph modelling and shortest path algorithm.
> - Use of route certainty based on the gaussian distribution of transport times between real and SBB forecasts. (Kafka, Spark).

### Constraint Optimization based on Machine Learning for Saipol traders

> Constraint optimization for traders (Datapred)
> - Mathematical translation of customer constraints.
> - Business Intelligence extraction of financial data.
> - Price forecasting and model tuning using sequential Machine Learning (Pandas, Scikit, SQL).
> - Constraint optimization with OR-Tools.
> - Providing meaningful Dashboard to the customer.

### Laboratory of Signal Processing - EPFL

> Semester Project with LTS5 (Medical Image Processing Laboratory)
> * Tuning of a neural network aimed to distinguish tumors regarding ultrasound images.
> * The architecture was based on the MNIST one

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
